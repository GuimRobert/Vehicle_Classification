# Project README

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to a dataset containing information about vehicles. The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and insights derived from the data.

## Contents
- **General Analysis**: Initial setup for the project, including data loading, data exploration, and data cleaning.
- **Cleaning Data**: Removal of redundant and sparse features, handling missing values, and mapping vehicle conditions.
- **Feature Relations**: Analysis of correlations between variables, scatter plots, and pair plots to visualize relationships.
- **Feature Analysis**: Histograms to understand the distribution of odometer readings and vehicle ages.
- **Decision-Making Process**: Discussion on selling vehicles based on specific criteria.

## Key Findings
- Identified and mapped similar vehicle conditions to reduce variety.
- Analyzed correlations between price, year, and odometer readings.
- Visualized trends in vehicle prices over the years and with odometer readings.
- Utilized unsupervised learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify potential vehicles for selling.

## Decision-Making Process
- Proposed criteria for selling vehicles based on age, odometer readings, and condition.
- Utilized clustering and anomaly detection algorithms to identify outliers for potential selling.
- Interpreted results of predictions to determine vehicles to consider for selling.

## Future Steps
- Incorporate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis on vehicle selling.
- Evaluate the impact of selling decisions on business performance and adjust criteria accordingly.

## Conclusion
The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the vehicle dataset, highlighting key insights, data cleaning processes, feature engineering techniques, and a decision-making framework for selling vehicles. By leveraging EDA, ML algorithms, and domain knowledge, informed decisions can be made to optimize business operations related to vehicle management.
